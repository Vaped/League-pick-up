If it's on git might as well make a readme o7 (can now access at work which helps)

### How it works
- List of players for a given round put into day_list.txt
- Run generator to make matchups
- Calculate +/- on https://www.3dkingdoms.com/chess/elo.htm (since the program for it is inting...)

### TO DO (a l o t)
- Prevent Generator from infinitely looping (can determine if this is still big problem with new changes)
- Automate changing of points (may require a lot of work)
- Fix the dakin bug
- *add actual discord integration in JS :)*
- *better method of storing data, maybe some DB integration (better waiting until JS is implemented)*
