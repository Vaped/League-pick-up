If it's on git might as well make a readme o7 (can now access at work which helps)

### How it works
- List of players for a given round put into day_list.txt
- Run generator to make matchups, list of players will be put into match_list.txt
- Run results after all matches are finished, updated points will be put into day_list.txt

### TO DO (a l o t)
- Combine two programs into one to avoid repeated code
- Full code maintenance
- *add actual discord integration in JS :)*
- *better method of storing data, maybe some DB integration (better waiting until JS is implemented)*
- Fix the dakin bug
